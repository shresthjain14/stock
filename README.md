This project analyzes the progression of six major banking stocks during the financial crisis period (2006â€“2016) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The aim is to explore stock market trends, evaluate risk and return, and uncover insights into the impact of the financial crisis on the banking sector.

Key aspects of the analysis include:

Tracking stock performance across the crisis period to identify patterns and anomalies.
Conducting risk and volatility analysis to understand market behavior.
Comparing the recovery trends of different banking institutions post-crisis.
Through visualizations and statistical analysis, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of how the financial crisis affected the banking sector and highlights the resilience or vulnerability of individual stocks during the recovery phase.
